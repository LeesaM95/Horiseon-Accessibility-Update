# Horiseon: Accessible Version


## Installation

This new version of the Horiseon website is meant to be more accessible for viewers who use accessibily aids, such as screen readers, to fully experience the website. The CSS was also restructured to follow the flow of the html for easier editing in the future. CSS was also consolidated for less-bulky editing and an overall more seamless stylesheet design.

## Usage

Users can now view Horiseon as a full website with accessibility traits intended for use by screen reader and other similiar tools.
